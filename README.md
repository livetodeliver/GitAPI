# GitAPI App Project

This is a simple app utilizing Github's API to search for a GitHub user by their ID. 

It was an assignment as part of [Thinkful's Full Stack Flex Program](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/flexible/) in which I learned how to:
* Make API requests using *fetch*
* Use *Postman* 
* display data from JSON responses
